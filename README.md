# Useful Aliases #

A zsh plugin where I define some useful aliases that I've put together.

## Installation ##

### zplug ###

Works with [zplug](http://https://github.com/zplug/zplug) quite well. To install
using zplug, place the following into your `zshrc`:

```zsh
zplug "s-gordon/useful-aliases"
```

## Aliases ##

### get_fname ###

Returns the argument without the file extension or path. Adapted from
[here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2664740/extract-file-basename-without-path-and-extension-in-bash).
